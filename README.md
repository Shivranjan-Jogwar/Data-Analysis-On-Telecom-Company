# Data-Analysis-On-Telecom-Company

As a beginner exploring the world of data analysis, I'm thrilled to share one of my recent projects: Customer Churn Analysis ðŸ“Š. 

This project involved diving deep into a dataset and using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, and Matplotlib to analyze customer churn behavior. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I worked on identifying trends and patterns, and created various visualizations to understand key factors behind customer churn.

Some highlights of my project:
- Conducted detailed descriptive analysis to understand the distribution of data.

- Explored features like SeniorCitizen, PhoneService, and InternetService to observe their relationship with churn.

- Created insightful countplots and histograms that help visualize the data, including comparisons of churn behavior across different categories.

- Converted raw data into actionable insights using several charts like stacked bar charts and histograms.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:
- Approximately 26.5% of customers churned, with a significant proportion being senior citizens.

- Features like OnlineSecurity and TechSupport showed a strong correlation with customer churn rates, offering potential areas for service improvement.

I'm excited to continue learning and exploring this dynamic field. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
